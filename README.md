# Pokemon App
This is Pokemon application, made with Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Flow, Hilt, and Material Desing and follows a multi-module MVVM Architecture. It shows a list of the first 100 Pokemon elements, the ability to search and the Pokemon details screen. 

## API 
```

```

## Artchitecture
The application follows Googleâ€™s Layered architecture design [guideline](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture). The app's overall architecture comprises of three layers: the UI, Domain Layer, and Data layers. 
Each of these has different responsibilities.

The solution makes use of a Unidirectional Flow of data between each of the layers, the UI Layer components send events to the Domain Layer, which in turn sends data requests to the Data Layer. In return, the Data Layers send data to the Domain Layer, which sends UI events to the UI layer. 

On the UI Layer, we make use of StateFlow for reactive state management. The views (composables) send events and observe data updates on the view model, and the view model responds by updating the state variables in question.

Modularization

To achieve a better code organization and a loosely coupled code base, we have separated each part into a different module. This is the dependency graph for all the modules defined on the app
